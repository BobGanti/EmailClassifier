# Email Classifier Project
Overview
This repository contains all necessary code and documentation for the Email Classifier, an AI-powered tool designed to automatically categorize emails into predefined categories based on their content. The classifier uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to understand and classify email text efficiently.
Features
1.	Email Classification: Automatically categorizes emails into classes such as "Problem/Fault", "Suggestion", etc.
2.	NLP Processing: Utilizes advanced NLP techniques for text preprocessing, feature extraction, and text classification.
3.	Pre-trained Models: Employs models like BERT or RandomForest as part of a classifier chain to improve accuracy.
4.	Scalability: Designed to handle large volumes of email data efficiently.
5.	Analytics Dashboard: (Optional) A dashboard to view the performance metrics and classification reports.
Technology Stack
6.	NLP Library: NLTK
7.	Machine Learning Frameworks: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch
8.	API: Flask for creating a RESTful API to interact with the classifier
9.	Front-end: Basic HTML/CSS for the dashboard (if applicable)
10.	Data Storage: SQLite/PostgreSQL for storing email data and classification results
